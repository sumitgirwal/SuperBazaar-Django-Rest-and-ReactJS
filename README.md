# SuperBazaar-Django-Rest-and-ReactJS
This project is an e-commerce shopping application built with Django Rest Framework as the backend and ReactJS as the frontend. The application allows users to view products, add products to a cart, and place orders. 

On the backend, Django Rest Framework is used to define models for products and orders, and create endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on those models. The backend also includes authentication views for user signup and login, which are protected by CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens to prevent unauthorized access.

On the frontend, ReactJS is used to create a dynamic user interface that communicates with the backend APIs. The frontend includes components for displaying a product list, product detail, and shopping cart. Users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout, which sends a request to the backend to create a new order. The frontend also includes user authentication components for signup and login.

The project utilizes RESTful API architecture, which allows for separation of concerns between the frontend and backend, making it easier to maintain and scale. The Django Rest Framework and ReactJS are both powerful and widely used frameworks that provide a solid foundation for building robust web applications. By combining these frameworks, developers can build modern, responsive, and scalable e-commerce applications that can handle a high volume of traffic and transactions.
